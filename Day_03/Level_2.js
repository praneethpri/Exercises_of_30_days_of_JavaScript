// 1) Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

// 2) Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c) 


// 3) Get length and width using prompt and calculate an area of rectangle (area = length x width) and the perimeter of rectangle (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))

// 4) Get radius using prompt and calculate the area of a circle (area = pi x r x r) and circumference of a circle(c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.
